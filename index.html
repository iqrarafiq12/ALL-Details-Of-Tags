    <h1>What Is a Front-End Developer?
    </h1>
    <!-- we have a peraghraph tag <p> also  -->
    <p>
      Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
      challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front
      end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
      developing.

      The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information
      in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a
      large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into
      consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly
      in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices
      (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
      <!-- if you need the line break then use <br> tag -->
      <br>
      <br>
      <!-- if going to make a bold your text then use <b></b> tags in with paraghrapgh like this -->
      <b> Front-End Roadmap With Definations </b>
      <!-- if you need the line break then use <br> tag -->
      <br>
      <!-- if going to make a italic your text then use <i></i> tags in with paraghrapgh like this -->
      <i> HTML CSS & JavaScript</i>
      <!-- if you need the line break then use <br> tag -->
      <br>
      A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML,
      CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web
      platform environments <!-- if you need to use the Link in your paraghrapgh then using like  this --> (i.e <a
        href="#">React Native</a>)
      <!-- The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript -->
      Adobe announced that it would discontinue the development of Flash for mobile devices and reorient its
      efforts in developing tools using HTML5.<sup>[22]</sup>
      <!-- The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. -->
      On 25 July 2017, Adobe announced that both the distribution and support of Flash would cease by the end of
      2020.<sub>[23]</sub>
      <!-- The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. -->
      Typically, a person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to develop
      <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
      <strong>javaScript </strong>Jwhich commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless
      browser,<strong>WebView,</strong> or as
      compilation input for a native runtime environment. These four run times scenarios are explained below.
      <!-- if you need the break line in your paraghrapgh then use this simple (method ) <hr> empty tag -->

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
